                    aurelia-interface can be used one of two ways. You can use the ai-layout with the components,

                    or you can simply use the individual components in your own application layout.

                    ### ai-layout

                    The ai-layout is a flex-box structured layout system, which provides a grid system similar to
                    that of BootstrapCSS's 12 column grid.


                    Below is a simple implementation of the ai-layout's structure.

            <div class="card-heading">
                HTML Structure
            </div>
            <div class="body">
                <markdown>
                    The **ai-interface** Element by default has a **flex-direction: column**
                    Which creates a single column, who's children are all rows.

                    Therefore, the **ai-header**, **ai-body** and the **ai-footer** are all rows sitting on top of one another.

                    The **ai-body** by default will have the opposite **flex-direction** as the **a-interface**. In this case the **ai-body** will have a **flex-direction: row**

                    A row creates a single ow with columns as children
                    Therefore the **ai-main** and **ai-aside** are both columns
                    The **ai-main** is simply a column wrapper for the router-view
                    The **ai-aside** has a default fixed width at 250px. This can by applying different properties.

                    aurelia-interface comes with a large collection of components. Each Component can be individually used as a plugin, Or you can use the entire collection.
