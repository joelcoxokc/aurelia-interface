                    aurelia-interface can be used one of two ways. You can use the ai-layout with the components,

                    or you can simply use the individual components in your own application layout.

                    ### ai-layout

                    The ai-layout is a flex-box structured layout system, which provides a grid system similar to
                    that of BootstrapCSS's 12 column grid.

                    The ai-layout also comes with fully configurable components. The layout components are similar to
                    HTML 5's layout tags like `<header>` and `<aside>` except ai-layout is using `<ai-header>` and `<ai-aside>`.

                    Below is a simple implementation of the ai-layout's structure.
